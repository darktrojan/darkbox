DarkBox
=======

DarkBox is a blatant clone of the [LightBox](http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/) software for displaying images. It uses CSS effects wherever possible, specifically CSS3 Transitions for animation, which means it looks super hot in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera. In older browsers it just looks hot.

*This repo now uses `classList` and `addEventListener`. For use with IE 8 or 9, you'll need a polyfill. I use https://github.com/darktrojan/shim.js.*

Example: Slideshow
------------------

To load a series of images, all you need to do is set an array of filenames to `DarkBox.list`, and call `DarkBox.show(x)` where `x` is an index in the array. To set descriptions, make `DarkBox.descriptions` an array of all the descriptions, or set individual descriptions. You can include HTML in your description.

	// list is an array of image URLs
	DarkBox.list = ["cat.jpg","telephoneboxes.jpg","dog.jpg"];
	// you can add to it programatically too
	DarkBox.list.push("cupcake.jpg");

	// descriptions is an array of descriptions, the index of each matches the appropriate image
	DarkBox.descriptions [1] = "Telephone Boxes";
	DarkBox.descriptions [3] = "<i>Individually Boxed Earth Cupcakes</i><br />by clevercupcakes";

Example: Individual image
-------------------------

DarkBox can display a single image, even if a list has been set. Just call `DarkBox.show(src, [desc])` where `src` is an image URL and `desc` is an optional description.

ContentBox
==========

ContentBox is an adaptation of DarkBox to display HTML elements such as modal windows.

	var test = document.getElementById('test');
	ContentBox.setContent(test, 600, 400);

You can set callbacks before and after ContentBox is shown or hidden for custom handling (e.g. to prevent it being hidden if the input of a form is invalid):

	ContentBox.afterShow = function() {
		test.style.background = 'green';
	};
	ContentBox.beforeHide = function() {
		test.style.background = '';
		// return false to prevent hiding
		return true;
	};
